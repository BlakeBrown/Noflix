Hack the North App

Tired of staying at home watching Netflix and chilling with your significant other?

Use our app, pick a location radius and price range, and go on an adventure.
Our app will call an Uber cab to come pick you up, and take you to someplace fun
from concerts to adventure rooms to parks to carnivals to malls to restaurants!

This is a demonstration of concept made in 36 hours for Hack the North 2015, 
however it may be picked up again in the future to be developed even further.

This technology wouldn't be available without Uber's API, Yelp's API and Eventbrite's API, and most of all, Hack the North.
